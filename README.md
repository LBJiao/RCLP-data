# RCLP-data
There are 40 cases here, which can be divided into four groups, each containing 10 cases, located in folders named '1', '2', '3', and '4'. Each .txt file represents the data of a case, where the first and second columns 
of the first row represent the type of truck and the number of drop-off points, respectively. The following rows represent data for each drop-off point, with the first column representing the serial number of the 
drop-off point, the second column representing the number of pallet types required for this drop-off point, and the following two columns alternating to represent the pallet type and corresponding quantity.
For example, in the 2.10input.txt file, the 1 and 5 in the first row indicate that the truck type is 1 and the number of drop-off points is 5, respectively. The next second to sixth rows represent the data of the five 
drop-off points, respectively. The second row is as follows:
0	7	0	1	1	1	2	1	3	0	4	1	5	1	6	2
where the first number indicates that the serial number of the drop-off point is 0, the second number indicates that the number of pallet types required for the drop-off point is 7, the third and fourth numbers respectively 
indicate that the number of pallets required for type 0 is 1, and the fifth and sixth numbers respectively indicate that the number of pallets required for type 1 is 1. And so on.
